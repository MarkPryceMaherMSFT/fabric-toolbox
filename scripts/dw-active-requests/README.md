This query simplifies the querying of dmvs in warehouse to show you what user queries are currently running and who is running them. In Fabric Data Warehouse we aligned closer to SQL DMVs, so if for users that are familiar with Synapse Dedicated Pools DMV output this will give you a similar view to what was available there. 

You can also install this as a view to abstract away the code.
