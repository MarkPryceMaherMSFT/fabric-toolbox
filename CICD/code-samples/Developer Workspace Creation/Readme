This code is used to create a workspace in Microsoft Fabric, assign roles to users, and assign capacity to the workspace. It uses the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL) to acquire tokens for authentication. The tokens can be acquired either by using a Service Principal Name (SPN) or by using a username and password. The main function parses command-line arguments for various parameters like tenant ID, client ID, client secret, etc., and then calls the other functions to create the workspace, assign roles, and assign capacity. The code also includes print statements for debugging purposes, so you can see whatâ€™s happening at each step. These could be removed or replaced with logging statements in a production environment. The code is well-structured and modular, making it easy to understand and maintain. Each function has a single responsibility, which is a good practice in software development. The use of command-line arguments makes the code flexible and easy to use in different environments or with different configurations. The error checking and console output make the code robust and user-friendly.
